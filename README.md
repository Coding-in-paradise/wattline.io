# wattline.io

Wattline.io is an alternative to the original powerline.io game with the server re-written in Golang with the chief goal to decrease latency. 

Wattline has several other features that distinguish it from the original powerline.io game, such as:

Re-write the backend in Golang to decrease latency. Use performance benchmarks to see the difference between deploying the server logic in TS/JS vs Golang. Add a profanity filter to prevent people from having usernames that are vulgar. Another purpose is to make the game family-friendly. Add other restrictions to usernames like no special characters

Add a leaderboard for the top 25 players in each category: K/D, highest score, etc. The leaderboard will update every 24 hours.

Remove gameplay chat.
